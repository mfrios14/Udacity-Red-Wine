# Udacity-Red-Wine
R project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This report shows how different red wine’s properties affect its quality. To do it, a dataset with the information of 1599 wines is analyzed. It registers properties such as its Ph, acidity, alcohol, density, residual sugar, among others. Each wine is ranked in a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is very bad and 10 excellent.

I start with a univariable analysis by plotting the different variables available. Then we continue with a multivariable analysis to find correlations between them and finally, with a better understanding of the variables’ behavior, a lineal model is created to predict the wine quality based on its properties
